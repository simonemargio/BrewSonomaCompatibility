## Running the `check.sh` script

To execute the `check.sh` script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have execute permission on the script. If you don't have permissions, you can grant them using the `chmod` command:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x check.sh
   ```

   Your account password is required to give permission to execute.

2. Now you can run the script using the `./check.sh` command. Make sure you are in the directory where the script is located or specify the full path if it's in a different directory:

   ```bash
   ./check.sh
   ```
